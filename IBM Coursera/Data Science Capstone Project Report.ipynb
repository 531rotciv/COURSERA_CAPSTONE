    "To analyze districts in Tokyo and neighbourhoods in Toronto with the goal of finding similarities between districts and neighbourhoods.  In the end, a recommendation to a company looking to open up a new location of where to build in order to succeed should be possible based on the similarities between the districts and neighbourhoods.  In order to do this, I will be using venues within each neighbourhood in Toronto, or district in Tokyo, as well as average income in each neighbourhood or district.  Similar districts will be clustered and displayed on maps of the regions. \n"

    "Culturally, there is a significant gap between the East and the West.  This can pose a challenge for companies to branch out from one region into another.  With this project, I hope to take a look at two cities, one on each side of the world, and determine where similarities exist that could allow a company to expand into an unfamiliar market. This project is designed to aid business owners in determining where they might want to focus their attention when attempting to build a new location."

    "Toronto provides a greater granularity in its average income data.  The continuous variable of average income before taxes will be grouped into ranges, represented by categories, that will be fed into the clustering algorithm.
