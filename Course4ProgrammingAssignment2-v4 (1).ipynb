    "# Assignment 2 - Implement your agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Course 4, Programming Assignment 2! We have learned about reinforcement learning algorithms for prediction and control in previous courses and extended those algorithms to large state spaces using function approximation. One example of this was in assignment 2 of course 3 where we implemented semi-gradient TD for prediction and used a neural network as the function approximator. In this notebook, we will build a reinforcement learning agent for control, again using a neural network for function approximation. This combination of neural network function approximators and reinforcement learning algorithms, often referred to as Deep RL, is an active area of research and has led to many impressive results (e. g., AlphaGo: https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far).\n",

    "  1. Extend the neural network code from assignment 2 of course 3 to output action-values instead of state-values.\n",
    "  2. Write up the Adam algorithm for neural network optimization.\n",
    "  3. Understand experience replay buffers.\n",
    "  4. Implement Softmax action-selection.\n",
    "  5. Build an Expected Sarsa agent by putting all the pieces together.\n",

    "## Section 1: Action-Value Network\n",
    "This section includes the function approximator that we use in our agent, a neural network. In Course 3 Assignment 2, we used a neural network as the function approximator for a policy evaluation problem. In this assignment, we will use a neural network for approximating the action-value function in a control problem. The main difference between approximating a state-value function and an action-value function using a neural network is that in the former the output layer only includes one unit whereas in the latter the output layer includes as many units as the number of actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, you will specify the architecture of the action-value neural network. More specifically, you will specify `self.layer_sizes` in the `__init__()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already provided `get_action_values()` and `get_TD_update()` methods. The former computes the action-value function by doing a forward pass and the latter computes the gradient of the action-value function with respect to the weights times the TD error. These `get_action_values()` and `get_TD_update()` methods are similar to the `get_value()` and `get_gradient()` methods that you implemented in Course 3 Assignment 2. The main difference is that in this notebook, they are designed to be applied to batches of states instead of one state. You will later use these functions for implementing the agent."

It keeps running estimates of the mean and second moment of the updates, denoted by $\\mathbf{m}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ respectively:\n",

    "Given that $\\mathbf{m}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are initialized to zero, they are biased toward zero. To get unbiased estimates of the mean and second moment, Adam defines $\\mathbf{\\hat{m}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}$ as:\n",

    "In Course 3, you implemented agents that update value functions once for each sample. We can use a more efficient approach for updating value functions. You have seen an example of an efficient approach in Course 2 when implementing Dyna. The idea behind Dyna is to learn a model using sampled experience, obtain simulated experience from the model, and improve the value function using the simulated experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience replay is a simple method that can get some of the advantages of Dyna by saving a buffer of experience and using the data stored in the buffer as a model. This view of prior data as a model works because the data represents actual transitions from the underlying MDP. Furthermore, as a side note, this kind of model that is not learned and simply a collection of experience can be called non-parametric as it can be ever-growing as opposed to a parametric model where the transitions are learned to be represented with a fixed set of parameters or weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided the implementation of the experience replay buffer in the cell below. ReplayBuffer includes two main functions: `append()` and `sample()`. `append()` adds an experience transition to the buffer as an array that includes the state, action, reward, terminal flag (indicating termination of the episode), and next_state. `sample()` gets a batch of experiences from the buffer with size `minibatch_size`.\n",

    "In this assignment, you will use a softmax policy. One advantage of a softmax policy is that it explores according to the action-values, meaning that an action with a moderate value has a higher chance of getting selected compared to an action with a lower value. Contrast this with an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy which does not consider the individual action values when choosing an exploratory action in a state and instead chooses randomly when doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of selecting each action according to the softmax policy is shown below:\n",
    "$$Pr{(A_t=a | S_t=s)} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\dot{=} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\frac{e^{Q(s, a)/\\tau}}{\\sum_{b \\in A}e^{Q(s, b)/\\tau}}$$\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is the temperature parameter which controls how much the agent focuses on the highest valued actions. The smaller the temperature, the more the agent selects the greedy action. Conversely, when the temperature is high, the agent selects among actions more uniformly random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that a softmax policy exponentiates action values, if those values are large, exponentiating them could get very large. To implement the softmax policy in a numerically stable way, we often subtract the maximum action-value from the action-values. If we do so, the probability of selecting each action looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Pr{(A_t=a | S_t=s)} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\dot{=} \\hspace{0.1cm} \\frac{e^{Q(s, a)/\\tau - max_{c}Q(s, c)/\\tau}}{\\sum_{b \\in A}e^{Q(s, b)/\\tau - max_{c}Q(s, c)/\\tau}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, you will implement the `softmax()` function. In order to do so, you could break the above computation into smaller steps:\n",

Then, the agent learns to avoid crashing by expending fuel and staying far above the ground. Finally however, it learns to land smoothly within the landing zone demarcated by the two flags (Episode 275)."
